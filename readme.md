This repo is for my twelfth-grade Topics in CS Class.
It contains each assignment (and it's link) of the semester along with a description of the assignment.

## Assignment1

[Assignment Description][1]

[1]:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EdhEGy4U3wLV29Oi38kUaCHYpPiIu03oW9MpInFG_sE/edit?usp=sharing

This assignment was to get start off the semester by creating a class repository and brushing up
on our java ability by creating a Mouse class that navigates on a grid.



## Assignment 2

[Assignment Description][2]

[2]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/179sECfjMzdR3NBe3PHTJZ3HNpJjzuD3Qqd3k-I0eLqA/edit?usp=sharing

In this I replicated ArrayList, stack and, queue objects. 
I then calculated the Big O complexity of each object's methods.



## Assignment 3

[Assignment Description][3]

[3]:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dSnq0lC3ci8NlBHaDiix1uBliIhxm7ObFmGehRQ-Z9A/edit?usp=sharing

In this assignment I created a Grid object for the mouse object from assignment 1 to navigate.
The grid contained integer values for each point and the values would change based on the mouse's movement.



## Assignment 4

[Assignment Description][4]

[4]:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GMEDcjGmDWVUmcTpBXPBRdE7mzhYCQcuHd-8NYmvU4k/edit?usp=sharing

In this assignment I created a LinkedList object which was made with nodes containing an value and pointer to another node.
I then created many methods to manipulate the list.



## Assignment5

[Assignment Description][5]

[5]:https://docs.google.com/document/d/13nr-_jyRHcOgh2hQ6g4lb1jbe18_2h_nLxNaO6vbu4o/edit?usp=sharing

This assignment I made a HashSet object as well as the add(), and isInSet() methods.
The second part was to test the efficiency of the different data structures by adding a different number of random integers and then seeing if they contain those integers.



## Assignment6

[Assignment Description][6]

[6]:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AowAkOicVwelqyohkkrxx7TfPJqwzV9YKlZPXVlc78k/edit?usp=sharing

In this assignment I created a Binary Search Tree (BST) object and the methods add() and print().
The next part was some simple recursion problems.




## Assignment7

Assignment seven had no deliverables and was mainly a catch up assignment, the next part was to create this markdown file.
